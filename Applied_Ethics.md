# Workshop in Applied Ethics
## Answer the Questions

**1) 1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?**

If all people were ethical in their interactions, there would be no need for the judiciary system since law enforcement and law itself is a direct product from trying to control unethical behavior.

**2)  Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.**

Banning smoking in public places. With the clean air act, it banned smoking in indoor and public places. After more research from tobacco was made and showed that second hand smoke was dangerous as well, it put the group (general population) before the individual (smoker)

**3) Bonus: Ethical codes are vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons. An ethical code relies on the cooperation of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior (aka defection) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the prinsoner's dilemma and the eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?**

A way to incentivize employees, is to hold random checks on random employees to make sure our code of ethics is being upheld. If after the check it is found that they are being upheld, provide a monetary award, because most of the time a person might be unethical is due to greed and greed being a product of money. Also if employees pass inspections, they will be more eligable to raises and promotions. We would also use technilogical mutation to change the frequency of the of the access to certain levels of security to prevent unauthorized access to data. 

## Class Activities

1) In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small tech startup. Then:
i)

   Leean Woo

   Joaquin Trujillo
   
   Bruce Liu
   
   ii) President: Vincent Feil
   
   iii) Computer that can run any Operating System/Software 
   
**2) Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society.**

  i) Pros: Economic freedom for the individual, ease of development, 
  cons: hinders ability to adapt to different softwares/UI, job market would be affected due to companies losing proprietary ownership of specific products, short term: Would force custoemrs to discard old laptops adding on to the harm of our environment.
  
  ii) 
  
  a. Immediately upon launch: Would cause a spike in laptops being thrown away and cause excess waste and impact on the enviornment

With those these specific codes of ethics, we would lose trust with the public, or our customers. Not only would it harm our trust with our customers and the general public, it would also cause legal troubles for our company which would ultimately cost the company money in the end. 

a. If we fail to follow copyright laws, it would open up doors for legal actions against our company. Not only would it cause legal troubles but force the public to lose trust in us due to the fact we are based off someone elses work. 

b. If we are not transparent with the information or data we take from our customers, again it would force the general public to lose trust in us. In this day and age of technology a big problem is data mining and/or selling customer data to customers for advertisement use. If we do not follow this ethic, then it would open up for our company, or individuals in our company to sell our customers information which people cherish their privacy in todays world. 

c. If we did not have this ethic, it would open up doors for higher ups in our company to prioritize certain organizations or individuals rather than our general customer population. Not only could it affect our customers but affect our company, with a big enough bribe some employees might feel inclined to sell sensitive information from our company itself. 

**ii) Below, discuss how, in retrospect, you should have stated the points of the Code, to make it robust to disruption.**

We could make sure to communicate to our employees what we exactly mean by our code of ethics, and what troubles it could bring our company. The issue being if we are very specific, some individuals might find loopholes within our code of ethcis and work around it.
