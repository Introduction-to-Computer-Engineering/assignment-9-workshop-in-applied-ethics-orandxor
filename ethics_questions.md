	1) I would assume that economics or anything related to finace excludeing at that leadership level. 
	Also law and law enforcement, would be less or not needed.
	
	2) For a not concluded event the 2016 election. 
	Since it is clear that the republicans are playing for the team. 
	Not for the good of the society.
	
	Automation of jobs would benefit the group not the indivdual,
	but that would depend on what stage of development the group is at.
	If the group is increasing volume and not enploying more, its a double gain.
	If the group is in constant volume and reducing enployment, its a group gain but indivdiual lost. 
	
	Its hard to tell basied on zoom level.
	What I mean be zoom level is self, group, country, society.
	Each one has a diffrent multiplier. 
			
	3) Since the ethics in this case is defined as norms of a group. 
	A rouge would be someone who gains from: 
	an interal exploit; 
	by changing group allegences;
	or sharing information between his or her two allegances "either one way or both ways".
	
	An acknowledgement of achevement is enough for most people. 
	Wage++ for time of allegance? and to lose the ++ if the allegence has shifted.
	But the counter to this is simply for the other side to make a higher bid.
	The scaler shifts to group. 
	The person would do more to darker things to boost their group.
	The other three would suffer. 
	Particularly if there is a bounty system.
	A penalty of non-informed change of allegence. Would be helpful.
	Also an increase of save of face behavior would likely be observed
